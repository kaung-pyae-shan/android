1. User Authentication
======================
  The user (admin) logs into the system with a username and password (either hardcoded or stored in a database).
  If credentials match, grant access to the system.
  If not, display an error message.

2. Borrower Management
======================
Add Borrower:
  Admin enters borrower details (Name, Contact, Address, etc.).
  Validate the input to ensure completeness and correctness (e.g., no empty fields).
  Check if the borrower already exists in the system (optional, based on a unique ID).
  Add the borrower to the database with a unique identifier (borrower ID).
  Display a success message once the borrower is added.

Edit Borrower:
  Admin selects a borrower to update.
  The system loads the borrower's current details from the database.
  Admin makes changes (e.g., phone number, address).
  After saving, validate the updated information and store it in the database.
  Display a confirmation message upon successful update.

Delete Borrower:
  Admin selects a borrower for deletion.
  The system checks if the borrower has any active loans.
  If the borrower has loans, prompt the admin to confirm deletion (e.g., "Deleting this borrower will delete their loans too").
  If the borrower has no loans, delete the borrower from the database.

3. Loan Application Management
==============================
Create New Loan:
  Admin selects a borrower to associate with the new loan.
  Admin inputs the following:
    Loan amount
    Interest rate (fixed or reducing balance)
    Loan duration (number of months)
    Start date

  System validates:
    Ensure loan amount is reasonable (e.g., not negative).
    Calculate the **EMI** (monthly payment) using formulas based on the interest type and loan duration.
    If the loan is valid, save the loan details in the database.

  Interest Calculation:
  If Fixed Interest, EMI is calculated using the formula:

      $$
      EMI = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
      $$

      Where:
        P = Principal loan amount
        r = monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
        n = loan duration in months
  If Reducing Balance Interest, EMI varies over time as the loan balance decreases.

Edit Loan:
  Admin selects an existing loan to edit.
  Admin changes loan details (e.g., loan amount, interest rate, duration).
  Validate changes (e.g., does the new loan amount exceed the remaining loan balance?).
  Recalculate EMI if necessary and update the loan record in the database.

Delete Loan:
  Admin selects a loan to delete.
  If the loan has been paid off fully, delete the loan record from the database.
  If the loan has pending payments, prompt the admin to confirm deletion. Optionally, the admin can write off the loan as "defaulted" if necessary.

4. Repayment Tracking
=====================

Record Repayment:
----------------
  Admin records a payment made by the borrower.
  Admin inputs:
    Payment date
    Payment amount

  System validates:
    Does the payment amount match the outstanding balance?
    Check for any overdue payments.
    Update the loan balance and mark the payment as "completed" in the database.
  If the loan is paid off fully, update the loan status to "Completed" or "Closed".
  Optionally, generate a receipt or confirmation message.

View Repayment History:
----------------------
  The system fetches all payments made by a borrower.
  Displays a list with dates, amounts, and remaining balances.
  Highlight overdue payments in red (if any).

Outstanding Balance:
-------------------
  For each loan, calculate the remaining balance after each payment.
  If payments are made regularly, the outstanding balance will gradually decrease.
  Display this balance along with any overdue amount.

5. Interest and EMI Calculation
===============================

EMI Calculation:
---------------
On loan creation, the system calculates the EMI using the interest rate and loan duration.
For a fixed-rate loan:
    $$
    EMI = \frac{P \times r \times (1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
    $$

For a reducing balance loan:
    $$
    EMI = \text{Fixed amount} + Interest (calculated on the reducing balance)
    $$

The system uses these calculations to display the EMI and the amortization schedule (a table showing payments over time).

Interest Calculation:
--------------------
Calculate the interest due for the given period.
Display the total interest that the borrower will pay over the life of the loan.

6. Dashboard
============
Display summary statistics:

Total number of borrowers
Total loan amount disbursed
Total outstanding balance
Total repayments made
Show a **list of overdue loans**:

Loans that are past due, along with the overdue amount.

7. Reports
==========

Generate Reports:

Admin can generate reports:
  List of all loans with borrower information.
  Repayment history for a specific loan.
  Outstanding balances for all loans.
The system fetches data from the database and presents it in a user-friendly format (CSV, PDF, etc.).
-------------------------------------------

Data Flow Overview:
==================
1. **Borrower Added → Loan Application Created → Loan Disbursed**
2. **Repayment Recorded → EMI Updated → Remaining Balance Updated**
3. **Dashboard Updates → Overdue Loans Highlighted**
4. **Report Generated → Data Extracted for Admin**





























### Example Scenario:

1. **Step 1**: Admin adds a new borrower named *John Doe*.

  * Inputs: Name, Contact, Address.
  * The system validates and adds John to the database.

2. **Step 2**: Admin creates a loan for John.

  * Inputs: Loan amount = \$10,000, Interest rate = 5%, Duration = 12 months.
  * System calculates EMI and loan details.
  * The loan is saved in the database.

3. **Step 3**: John makes his first repayment of \$1,000.

  * Admin records the payment.
  * The system updates the loan balance and displays the new outstanding amount.

4. **Step 4**: Admin generates a report showing all loans and repayments.

  * The system outputs a summary of all loans, including their statuses.
